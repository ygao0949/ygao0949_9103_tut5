# Quiz 8 â€“ Imaging and Coding Technique Research

This file documents the design and technical research that supports the development of my individual animation for the final assignment in IDEA9103.

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

My inspiration comes from *Volumes* by Maxim Zhestkov, an interactive particle-based animation where motion design and organic patterns merge through billions of colored particles. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to the way these particles flow and shift as if moved by invisible forces. I plan to incorporate this sense of fluid, user-driven movement by making each circular unit in *Wheels of Fortune* react to mouse positionâ€”modifying color, rhythm, or shape. This technique helps me enrich the visual rhythm and differentiate repeated elements through interaction, aligning with the assignmentâ€™s goal of creating diverse, animated responses.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To explore the interactive particle behavior inspired by *Volumes*, I found a p5.js sketch that creates dynamic particles in response to mouse input. Each particle is initialized with random `velocity`, `hue`, and `lifespan`, resulting in a constantly evolving, flowing animation. The code uses `mouseIsPressed` to generate new particles and `createVector()` to manage motion. It also sets `colorMode(HSB)` to enable vivid color changes and fading effects. I plan to adapt this technique to animate the circular units in *Wheels of Fortune*, enabling local movement and color variation as a response to user interaction.
